Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project a lane detection algrithm are implemented using Python and OpenCV. 

The main project files contains:

File/Folder | Description
------------ | -------------
P1.ipynb | all implementation of the lane detection pipeline, both for images and vedios
writeup.md | writeup of this project
test_images | Folder of the originial images
test_images_output | Folder of the output images with detected lane drawing on them
test_videos | Folder of the originial videos
test_videos_output | Folder of the output videos with detected lane drawing on them
